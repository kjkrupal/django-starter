## Ranking

One of the benefits of full text search we mentioned early in the tutorial is the ability to sort search results by relevancy. Postgres uses an algorithm to determine relevancy that takes into account factors such as how many times the query text appears in the document and how close the terms are to each other in the document. Reference the [Ranking Search Results](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/textsearch-controls.html) documentation for a more in-depth explanation.

The important thing to know is that Postgres has a `ts_rank()` function that calculates a relevancy score for a match. Django provides a complementary `SearchRank()` function that uses `ts_rank()` in the SQL query. One more important aspect of relevancy -- Postgres lets you attribute "weight" to the fields involved in full text search. By setting a weight, you can boost the relevancy score of results that match certain fields over others. In PostgreSQL, a weight of `A` gives the greatest boost, while `B`, `C`, and `D` reduce the relevancy score of the results in that order.

Let's boost the relevancy of results that match the `variety` and `winery` fields over the `description` field. Logically, if the term we're searching appears in the wine's variety or winery, then that record is probably more important than one that contains the term in the description.

Edit the *filters.py* file in the following way.

```python
# server/perusable/catalog/filters.py

from django.contrib.postgres.search import SearchQuery, SearchRank, SearchVector # changed
from django.db.models import F, Q # changed

from django_filters.rest_framework import CharFilter, FilterSet

from .models import Wine


class WineFilterSet(FilterSet):
    query = CharFilter(method='filter_query')

    def filter_query(self, queryset, name, value): # changed
        search_query = Q(
            Q(search_vector=SearchQuery(value))
        )
        return queryset.annotate(
            search_vector=(
                SearchVector('variety', weight='A') + 
                SearchVector('winery', weight='A') +
                SearchVector('description', weight='B')
            ),
            search_rank=SearchRank(F('search_vector'), SearchQuery(value))
        ).filter(search_query).order_by('-search_rank')

    class Meta:
        model = Wine
        fields = ('query', 'country', 'points',)
```

Refresh your browser and look at the SQL in the Django Debug Toolbar. The query should look something like the following. (Remember I'm simplifying the SQL slightly in all my examples.)

```sql
SELECT *, ts_rank(
  (
    setweight(to_tsvector(variety), 'A') ||
    setweight(to_tsvector(winery), 'A') ||
    setweight(to_tsvector(coalesce(description, '')), 'B')
  ),
  plainto_tsquery('merlot')
) AS search_rank
  FROM catalog_wine
 WHERE (
   (
     setweight(to_tsvector(variety), 'A') ||
     setweight(to_tsvector(winery), 'A') ||
     setweight(to_tsvector(coalesce(description, '')), 'B')
   ) @@ plainto_tsquery('merlot')
 )
   AND points = 90
   AND country = 'US'
 ORDER BY search_rank DESC;
```

This query still returns 489 results. Do you notice anything different about the order? Try swapping the weights so that `variety` and `winery` have `B` and `description` has `A`. Test the results using the UI for a better experience. Don't forget to reset the weights before moving to the next section.
