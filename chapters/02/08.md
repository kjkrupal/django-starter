## Next Steps

1. Instead of installing Django Debug Toolbar, we can monitor all SQL queries that run in the app using [logging](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/topics/logging/#django-db-backends). Hint: run `docker-compose` without the `-d` argument to see the `stdout` print in your terminal. Once you get things up and running in Django, see if you can configure logging in [Gunicorn](http://docs.gunicorn.org/en/latest/settings.html#logging) to save to a file.
2. Can you modify the wine `search()` function to rank exact matches higher than the matches found by full text search? For example, if the user searches for *processed*, then rank the matches containing the exact word, *processed*, higher than *process* or *processing*. Hint: see [conditional expressions](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/ref/models/conditional-expressions/).
3. What happens when the user searches for multiple words in a single query? How can you change the matching behavior that Django uses? Hint: review [the SubQuery documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/ref/contrib/postgres/search/#searchquery).
4. Trigram similarity matches `cabarnet` and `cabernet` when using the default *similarity threshold*. How does changing the value to something other than `0.3` change the results?
5. **ADVANCED** Use the [Levenshtein distance](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/fuzzystrmatch.html#id-1.11.7.24.6) instead of trigram similarity. You'll need to [install](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/sql-createextension.html) the `fuzzystrmatch` Postgres extension and create custom code to call the `levenshtein()` function.
