## Postgres

As we mentioned earlier in the tutorial, Django has built-in support for [PostgreSQL features](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/ref/contrib/postgres/). Full text search is one of those features. If we want to leverage them, then we have to add the proper Django app in the `*settings.py* file.

```python
# server/perusable/perusable/settings.py

DJANGO_APPS = [
    'django.contrib.admin',
    'django.contrib.auth',
    'django.contrib.contenttypes',
    'django.contrib.sessions',
    'django.contrib.messages',
    'django.contrib.staticfiles',
    'django.contrib.postgres', # new
]
```

Before we refactor our code to use full text search, let's remind ourselves how our current search works.

Visit [http://localhost:8080/api/v1/catalog/wines/?country=US&points=90&query=merlot](http://localhost:8080/api/v1/catalog/wines/?country=US&points=90&query=merlot) in your browser. Using the newly installed Django Debug Toolbar, explore the database queries that were run by clicking the **SQL** panel.

You should see SQL code that looks similar to the following. (Note that I simplified the query slightly. Django explicitly names each field instead of using the `*` operator.)

```sql
SELECT *
  FROM catalog_wine
 WHERE (
   variety LIKE '%merlot%' OR
   winery LIKE '%merlot%' OR
   description LIKE '%merlot%'
 )
   AND points = 90
   AND country = 'US';
```

Let's run this query directly in the `psql` CLI to confirm that the results are equivalent.

```
(venv)$ docker-compose exec database psql -U perusable
```

Paste the SQL query above in the `psql` terminal and press the `RETURN` key to view more lines. (Hint: The screen will be a lot less crowded if you select a couple fields rather than all of them.) The results should look the same as what appeared in the browser. Exit the `psql` CLI by with `\q`.

Now we're ready to implement full text search. The most basic way to use this feature is to change our `icontains` lookup expressions to `search`. Behind the scenes, Django performs the necessary conversions to create `tsvector` and `tsquery` data structures and execute the search.

Change the *filters.py* file to the following to see it in action.

```python
# server/perusable/catalog/filters.py

from django.db.models import Q

from django_filters.rest_framework import CharFilter, FilterSet

from .models import Wine


class WineFilterSet(FilterSet):
    query = CharFilter(method='filter_query')

    # changed
    def filter_query(self, queryset, name, value):
        search_query = Q(
            Q(variety__search=value) |
            Q(winery__search=value) |
            Q(description__search=value)
        )
        return queryset.filter(search_query)

    class Meta:
        model = Wine
        fields = ('query', 'country', 'points',)
```

Refresh your browser and open the **SQL** panel again. The query looks very different. Django ran a full text search by converting the `winery` and `description` field of every `Wine` record to a `tsvector`. It also converted the query to a `tsquery` and then used the `@@` operator to do the comparison.

Test the following SQL code in the `psql` CLI if you want to see the query run firsthand. (Note that we use the `coalesce()` function for the `description` field because it can be `NULL`. Read more [here](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/textsearch-controls.html).)

```sql
SELECT *
  FROM catalog_wine
 WHERE (
   to_tsvector(variety) @@ plainto_tsquery('merlot') OR
   to_tsvector(winery) @@ plainto_tsquery('merlot') OR
   to_tsvector(coalesce(description, '')) @@ plainto_tsquery('merlot')
 )
   AND points = 90
   AND country = 'US';
```

If you test the SQL query, then you'll see that the full text search query returns 489 results in comparison to 2 results with the simple search. One reason for the discrepancy is because full text search ignores case.

> Wondering what actually happens when you run the `to_tsvector()` and `plainto_tsquery()` functions in Postgres? Try the following examples to satisfy your curiosity.

> ```sql
> SELECT to_tsvector('The wine is raw, chewy and succulent on the close.');
> SELECT plainto_tsquery('chewy');
> ```

The `search` lookup expression is nice, but if we want finer-grained control over the full text search behavior, then we need to modify the code. Refactor the code in the *filters.py* file to the following.

```python
# server/perusable/catalog/filters.py

from django.contrib.postgres.search import SearchQuery, SearchVector # new
from django.db.models import Q

from django_filters.rest_framework import CharFilter, FilterSet

from .models import Wine


class WineFilterSet(FilterSet):
    query = CharFilter(method='filter_query')

    def filter_query(self, queryset, name, value): # changed
        search_query = Q(
            Q(search_vector=SearchQuery(value))
        )
        return queryset.annotate(
            search_vector=SearchVector('variety', 'winery', 'description')
        ).filter(search_query)

    class Meta:
        model = Wine
        fields = ('query', 'country', 'points',)
```

Here, we are explicitly doing the work that Django did behind the scenes with `search` with one exception -- we're combining the `winery` and `description` text into a single document. The `search_vector` annotation holds that document text. See the following SQL query for reference.

```sql
SELECT *
  FROM catalog_wine
 WHERE (
   to_tsvector(
     coalesce(variety, '') 
     || ' ' 
     || coalesce(winery, '')
     || ' '
     || coalesce(description, '')
   ) @@ plainto_tsquery('merlot')
 )
   AND points = 90
   AND country = 'US';
```

Refresh your browser and you should notice that the results are exactly the same. Can you guess the benefit of combining the text into a single document? Keep reading to learn why we made that decision.
