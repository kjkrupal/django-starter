## Spelling Mistakes

Full text search works great when you submit a query that returns matches, but what if you misspell a word? Postgres won't find any matches and you'll get an empty response. The good news is that we can mitigate that bad experience by making suggestions to users as they type misspelled words. And we can power our suggestions using another part of Postgres' full text search library.

Let's begin by creating a database table to hold all of the unique words that appear in our `Wine` records. Add the following code to the bottom of the *models.py* file.

```python
# server/perusable/catalog/models.py

class WineSearchWord(models.Model):
    word = models.CharField(max_length=255, unique=True)

    def __str__(self):
        return self.word
```

Add an admin page too.

```python
# server/perusable/catalog/admin.py

from django.contrib import admin

from .models import Wine, WineSearchWord # changed


@admin.register(Wine)
class WineAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    fields = (
        'id', 'country', 'description', 'points', 'price', 'variety', 'winery',
        'search_vector',
    )
    list_display = ('id', 'country', 'points', 'price', 'variety', 'winery',)
    list_filter = ('country', 'variety', 'winery',)
    ordering = ('variety',)
    readonly_fields = ('id',)


@admin.register(WineSearchWord) # new
class WineSearchWordAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    fields = ('word',)
    list_display = ('word',)
    ordering = ('word',)
```

This should look familiar -- make one migration to create a new database table and another to populate it with data.

```
(venv)$ python manage.py makemigrations catalog
(venv)$ python manage.py makemigrations catalog --name update_wine_search_word --empty
```

We're going to use the `ts_stat()` Postgres function in our data migration. The [Postgres documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/textsearch-features.html#TEXTSEARCH-STATISTICS) states that `ts_stat()` performs a query and returns results with the columns: `word`, `ndoc`, and `nentry`. The column we care about is `word`. Each word returned by `ts_stat()` is unique, so we can use the results to build our `WineSearchWord` records.

Replace the contents of the *0005_update_wine_search_word.py* migration with the following code.

```python
# server/perusable/catalog/migrations/0005_update_wine_search_word.py

from django.contrib.postgres.operations import TrigramExtension
from django.db import connection, migrations


def update_wine_search_word(apps, schema_editor):
    sql = """
        INSERT INTO catalog_winesearchword (word)
        SELECT word FROM ts_stat('
          SELECT to_tsvector(''simple'', winery) ||
                 to_tsvector(''simple'', coalesce(description, ''''))
            FROM catalog_wine
        ');
    """
    with connection.cursor() as cursor:
        cursor.execute(sql)


class Migration(migrations.Migration):

    dependencies = [
        ('catalog', '0004_winesearchword'),
    ]

    operations = [
        TrigramExtension(),
        migrations.RunSQL(sql="""
            CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS wine_search_word_trigram_index
                ON catalog_winesearchword
             USING gin (word gin_trgm_ops);
        """, elidable=True),
        migrations.RunPython(update_wine_search_word, elidable=True),
    ]
```

Note that we also install the [pg_trgm](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/pgtrgm.html) module (using `TrigramExtension()`) and create a [gin_trgm_ops](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/pgtrgm.html#id-1.11.7.40.7) index on the `word` column.

> The `pg_trgm` module is required to use the *trigram* `similarity()` functions.

Run the migrations on the server.

```
(venv)$ docker-compose exec server python /usr/src/app/perusable/manage.py migrate
```

In a previous step, we configured a signal to update the `search_vector` field on a saved `Wine` record. We need to do something similar to update our wine search words. We're going to use a concept known as an `upsert` ([update or insert](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/sql-insert.html)) to add new words. Of wine, an updated `Wine` record can contain a lot of words that are already in the `catalog_winesearchword` table, so we want to ignore those.

Update the *signals.py* file in the following way.

```python
# server/perusable/catalog/signals.py

from django.contrib.postgres.search import SearchVector
from django.db import connection # new
from django.db.models.signals import post_save
from django.dispatch import receiver

from .models import Wine


@receiver(post_save, sender=Wine, dispatch_uid='on_wine_save')
def on_wine_save(sender, instance, *args, **kwargs):
    sender.objects.filter(pk=instance.id).update(search_vector=(
        SearchVector('winery', weight='A') +
        SearchVector('description', weight='B')
    ))

    # new
    with connection.cursor() as cursor:
        cursor.execute(f"""
            INSERT INTO catalog_winesearchword (word)
            SELECT word FROM ts_stat('
              SELECT to_tsvector(''simple'', winery) ||
                     to_tsvector(''simple'', coalesce(description, ''''))
                FROM catalog_wine
               WHERE id = {instance.id}
            ')
            ON CONFLICT (word) DO NOTHING;
        """)
```

Now that we have a record of all the unique words in our wine catalog, we can make suggestions to users who search for misspelled words by guessing the correct spellings. Our strategy will be to find words that are *similar* to a user's search term using a [trigram similarity algorithm](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/pgtrgm.html#id-1.11.7.40.4).

According to the Postgres documentation:

> A trigram is a group of three consecutive characters taken from a string. We can measure the similarity of two strings by counting the number of trigrams they share.

Consider an example where a user searches for the misspelled word, *merlo*. If we run the `SELECT show_trgm('merlo');` query in `psql`, then we get the following result.

```
{"  m"," me",erl,"lo ",mer,rlo}
```

Running `SELECT show_trgm('merlot');` returns the following.

```
{"  m"," me",erl,lot,mer,"ot ",rlo}
```

In order to find the *similarity* between *merlo* and *merlot*, we take the intersection between the two trigram sets and divide its length by the length of the union. Consult the following example.

```
       union: {"  m", " me", erl, lot, "lo ", mer, "ot ", rlo}
intersection: {"  m", " me", erl, mer, rlo}
```

Divide the *intersection* length by the *union* length. Does your value match the output of the following?

```sql
SELECT similarity('merlot', 'merlo');
```

Modify the code in *models.py* to the following.

```python
# server/perusable/catalog/models.py

import uuid

from django.contrib.postgres.indexes import GinIndex
from django.contrib.postgres.search import ( # changed
    SearchQuery, SearchRank, SearchVectorField, TrigramSimilarity
)
from django.db import models
from django.db.models import F, Q


class WineQuerySet(models.query.QuerySet):
    # Hidden for clarity.


class Wine(models.Model):
    # Hidden for clarity.


class SearchHeadline(models.Func):
    # Hidden for clarity.


# new
class WineSearchWordQuerySet(models.query.QuerySet):
    def search(self, query):
        return self.annotate(
            similarity=TrigramSimilarity('word', query)
        ).filter(similarity__gte=0.3).order_by('-similarity')


class WineSearchWord(models.Model):
    word = models.CharField(max_length=255, unique=True)

    objects = WineSearchWordQuerySet.as_manager() # new

    def __str__(self):
        return self.word
```

Note that we are creating a `WineSearchWordQuerySet` class with a `search()` function like we did for `WineQuerySet`. We're invoking the Postgres `similarity()` function with Django's `TrigramSimilarity()` function. How did we pick the value `0.3`? By default, Postgres uses a *similarity threshold* of `0.3`, so we used the default.

We're going to add a new API endpoint for making suggestions. The first step is to add a serializer for the response payload. Add a new `WineSearchWordSerializer` to the *serializers.py* file as follows.

```python
# server/perusable/wines/serializers.py

from rest_framework import serializers

from .models import Wine, WineSearchWord # changed


class WineSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    # Hidden for clarity.


class WineSearchWordSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer): # new
    class Meta:
        model = WineSearchWord
        fields = ('word',)
```

Next, add a new `WineSearchWordFilterSet` to the *filters.py* file as in the example below.

```python
# server/perusable/wines/filters.py

from django_filters.rest_framework import CharFilter, FilterSet

from .models import Wine, WineSearchWord # changed


class WineFilterSet(FilterSet):
    query = CharFilter(method='filter_query')

    def filter_query(self, queryset, name, value):
        return queryset.search(value)

    class Meta:
        model = Wine
        fields = ('query', 'country', 'points',)


# new
class WineSearchWordFilterSet(FilterSet):
    query = CharFilter(method='filter_query')

    def filter_query(self, queryset, name, value):
        return queryset.search(value)

    class Meta:
        model = WineSearchWord
        fields = ('query',)
```

Add a new `WineSearchWordsView` in the *views.py* file and use the serializer and the filter that we just created.

```python
# server/perusable/catalog/views.py

from rest_framework.generics import ListAPIView

from .models import Wine, WineSearchWord # changed
from .serializers import WineSerializer, WineSearchWordSerializer # changed
from .filters import WineFilterSet, WineSearchWordFilterSet # changed


class WinesView(ListAPIView):
    queryset = Wine.objects.all()
    serializer_class = WineSerializer
    filterset_class = WineFilterSet


# new
class WineSearchWordsView(ListAPIView):
    queryset = WineSearchWord.objects.all()
    serializer_class = WineSearchWordSerializer
    filterset_class = WineSearchWordFilterSet
```

Finally, add a new `/wine-search-words/` path to the *catalog* app's URL configuration in the *urls.py* file and link it to the new view.

```python
# server/perusable/catalog/urls.py

from django.urls import path

from .views import WinesView, WineSearchWordsView # changed

urlpatterns = [
    path('wines/', WinesView.as_view()),
    path('wine-search-words/', WineSearchWordsView.as_view()), # new
]
```

It's time to test our new API. Visit [http://localhost:8080/api/v1/catalog/wine-search-words/?query=merlo](http://localhost:8080/api/v1/catalog/wine-search-words/?query=merlo) in your browser.

![wine search words API](/images/02_wine_search_words_api.png)

Here's the comparable SQL query if you want to test it in `psql`.

```sql
SELECT word, similarity(word, 'merlo') AS similarity
  FROM catalog_winesearchword
 WHERE similarity(word, 'merlo') >= 0.3
 ORDER BY similarity DESC;
```

Your final directory structure should look like the following (minus the *venv* folder and compiled files).
