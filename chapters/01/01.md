## System Design

Before we jump into the coding, let's take a quick look at our proposed system design.

In the diagram above, we can see that the client interacts with a **reverse-proxy**, which in turn communicates with a **server**. The **server** reads and writes data to a **database**. All of these components are on separate machines. As traffic to our site increases, each one of these components will become a single-point-of-failure, a weak link in the chain of communication, and will require more resources. We will need to decide between scaling vertically (replacing single machines with more powerful ones) and scaling horizontally (adding more machines for a single component and distributing traffic between them). Separating our system in this way will ease the process of scalability.

> Scalability is a complex issue and the decisions surrounding it require the engineer to consider many factors. I'd encourage you to read the excellent [System Design Primer](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer#next-steps) for a deep dive into those factors.

You might be wondering what role each of these components will play in our application.

The **database** stores our application's state. Any information that needs to persist between sessions is written to and read from the database.

The **server** holds the application code that lets users manipulate the **database**. The **client** sends requests to API endpoints on the **server** to access **database** resources. The **server** is in charge of a coordinating a lot of behavior. It must interpret HTTP request paths to determine the correct business logic to execute. It must maintain connections to other services, maintain system resources and files, and handle errors.

The **reverse-proxy** takes some of the burden off the **server**. It can be used for load balancing, to distribute incoming requests among different **servers** to avoid overwhelming a single machine. It can handle security and SSL termination. It can cache frequently seen requests and pass back stored response payloads without hitting the **servers**. It's also useful for serving static assets (i.e. HTML, CSS, JS files) directly.

This tutorial aims to teach you the basics of each component and how they fit together.
