## Initial Setup

Our application uses:

- Python (v3.8)
- Django (v3.0)
- Docker Engine (v19.03.5)
- Docker Compose (v1.24.1)
- Postgres (v12.1)
- Nginx (v1.17)
- Gunicorn (v20.0)
- Django REST Framework (v3.11)
- Django Filters (v2.2)

Before you begin this tutorial, you will need a recent version of Python 3 on your machine. If you are using Mac OS and don't have Python 3, I recommend installing it using [Homebrew](https://docs.python-guide.org/starting/install3/osx/). You will also need the latest version of [Docker](https://hub.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-mac).

Once you have installed the required software on your machine, navigate to a directory where you keep your projects. Make a new *perusable* directory using the terminal and step inside.

```
$ mkdir perusable && cd perusable
```

Next, make a *server* directory inside the *perusable* directory. Change directories to *server*.

```
$ mkdir server && cd server
```

From within *server*, create a *requirements.txt* file with the following code.

```conf
# server/requirements.txt

Django==3.0.1
```

The *requirements.txt* file lists all of our project's Python dependencies and their versions.

Next, create a virtual environment with the Python `venv` module. Running these commands will create a *venv* directory in your *server* folder with the Python dependencies installed inside. When we activate the virtual environment using the `source` command, the terminal will use the Python libraries inside the *venv* folder instead of the ones installed directly to our local machine.

```
$ python3 -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate
```

After you run the `source` command, you should see `(venv)` at the beginning of the command prompt in your terminal, indicating that the virtual environment is being used.

Next, install the Python dependencies into the virtual environment using the `pip` tool.

```
(venv)$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

After the installation finishes, you should see a success message like the following.

```
Successfully installed Django-3.0.1 asgiref-3.2.3 pytz-2019.3 sqlparse-0.3.0
```

Django is installed to the *server/venv/lib/python3.8/site-packages* directory. Take a look now to confirm it's there.

Create a new `perusable` Django project and step inside the directory that gets made.

```
(venv)$ django-admin startproject perusable && cd perusable
```

Inside the Django project directory, create a new `catalog` Django app.

```
(venv)$ python manage.py startapp catalog
```

At this point, your directory structure should look like the following. (The *venv* directory is hidden from this view.)

```
.
├── catalog
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── admin.py
│   ├── apps.py
│   ├── migrations
│   │   └── __init__.py
│   ├── models.py
│   ├── tests.py
│   └── views.py
├── manage.py
└── perusable
    ├── __init__.py
    ├── settings.py
    ├── urls.py
    └── wsgi.py
```

Change directories back to the *server/perusable* path and then run the following commands in the terminal.

```
(venv)$ export DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE="perusable.settings"
(venv)$ python manage.py migrate
```

Running the `migrate` Django management command runs migrations on your database. Migrations bring your database from one valid state to another and involve altering tables and the data within them. You should see the following text printed to your terminal.

```
Operations to perform:

```

You might be wondering where these migrations originated and what database was migrated. The Django library comes with standard migrations that must be run to bring the application to an initial state. By default, Django uses an SQLite database. When you run the `migrate` command, a new SQLite database file is created in your project's directory if one does not already exist. Later in the tutorial, we will replace the default SQLite database with Postgres.

Now that our database is initialized, run the development server using the following command.

```
(venv)$ python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
```

Visit [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) in your browser to see Django's default page. If your browser is displaying something like the screenshot below, then you know your application is working!

![default Django page](/images/01_default_django_page.png)

In your terminal, press `CTRL+C` to stop the development server.

From your *server* directory, create a new *start.sh* file with the following code.

```sh
# server/start.sh

#!/bin/bash

python ./perusable/manage.py migrate
python ./perusable/manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
```

Now we can run the `migrate` and `runserver` commands serially with a single script. Try it out in your terminal.

```
(venv)$ chmod +x start.sh
(venv)$ ./start.sh
```

Refresh your browser. You should see the same page that you saw previously. Press `CTRL+C` to bring the development server down again.
