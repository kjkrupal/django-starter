## Next Steps

Let's review the topics we covered in **Part I**.

- A good introductory system design uses a reverse-proxy, a server, and a database to support an application. Separating the components onto different machines eases the job of scaling the system to handle more users.
- Docker can be used to containerize each system component, and Docker containers can operate together as an application.
- Django can be used to create APIs that the client can use to access resources in the database. Django REST Framework makes developing APIs easier.
- Django can be configured to use Postgres as a database. Django supports many PostgreSQL-specific functions by default.
- The Django development server should not be used in a production environment. The Gunicorn WSGI server can be used in conjunction with the Nginx reverse-proxy in place of the development server.

Now that you've created the foundation of the wine catalog app, try completing the following exercises to boost your knowledge and understanding:

1. Add support for [user-uploaded files](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/topics/files/). Add a `thumbnail` field to the `Wine` model and allow access to it through the admin. You'll have to handle the `media` directory the same way you handled the `static` directory on the server, the reverse-proxy, and the Docker container. Hint: You might also need a new Python dependency.
1. Add GIN indexes for the `variety`, `winery` and `description` fields to improve database performance. You'll need to [create the indexes](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/pgtrgm.html#id-1.11.7.40.7) using the `pg_trgm` module. This is easy to do [in Django](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/ref/contrib/postgres/indexes/#ginindex) as long as you have the [Trigram extension](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/ref/contrib/postgres/operations/#trigramextension) installed. Hint: Set `Index.opclasses` to `['gin_trgm_ops']`.
