## Postgres

Up to this point, we've been using Django's default SQLite database. Django recommends using Postgres and has many [PostgreSQL database packages](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/ref/contrib/postgres/) installed to support the unique features that the product offers.

Let's start by deleting the old SQLite database.

```
(venv)$ rm server/perusable/db.sqlite3
```

Next, edit your *docker-compose.yml* file to add a new `database` service.

```yml
# docker-compose.yml

version: '3.7'

services:
  # new
  database:
    container_name: perusable-database
    image: postgres:12.1
    ports:
      - 5433:5432
    volumes:
      - perusable-database:/var/lib/postgresql/data

  server:
    build:
      context: ./server
    container_name: perusable-server
    command: [ "bash", "start.sh" ]
    ports:
      - 8001:8000
    volumes:
      - ./server:/usr/src/app

# new
volumes:
  perusable-database:
```

Note that we are choosing to use the base Postgres image without adding any new commands to it, so we don't need a *database* directory or a *Dockerfile*. The *docker-compose.yml* file changes introduce a new `volumes` structure at the same level as `services`. Typically, the code in your container only exists as long as the container is running. When you stop the Docker container and start it again, everything is recreated from scratch from the image. Volumes let you store data outside of the container lifecycle. By adding the `perusable-database` volume, all of the data we write to Postgres will persist as the Docker container is started and stopped.

From the project's root directory, build the Docker container again.

```
(venv)$ docker-compose up -d --build
```

Note the `-d` flag. Specifying this flag runs `docker-compose` in the background. You can still see the status of the container by running `docker container ls`.

Start the `psql` tool in the `database` Docker container with the following command.

```
(venv)$ docker-compose exec database psql -U postgres
```

You should see something like the following in your terminal.

```
psql (12.1 (Debian 12.1-1.pgdg100+1))
Type "help" for help.

postgres=#
```

In the `psql` CLI, run the following commands one at a time.

```
CREATE USER perusable WITH SUPERUSER CREATEDB CREATEROLE PASSWORD 'perusable';
CREATE DATABASE perusable OWNER perusable;
```

These commands create a new user and database for our Django app to use.

Quit the `psql` CLI with `\q`.

Bring down the Docker container with `docker-compose down`. (No need to press `CTRL-C` when it's running in the background.)

Edit the *docker-compose.yml* file again to make the following changes.

```yml
# docker-compose.yml

version: '3.7'

services:
  database:
    container_name: perusable-database
    image: postgres:12.1
    ports:
      - 5433:5432
    volumes:
      - perusable-database:/var/lib/postgresql/data

  server:
    build:
      context: ./server
    container_name: perusable-server
    command: [ "bash", "start.sh" ]
    depends_on: # new
      - database
    environment: # new
      - PGDATABASE=perusable
      - PGUSER=perusable
      - PGPASSWORD=perusable
      - PGHOST=perusable-database
    ports:
      - 8001:8000
    volumes:
      - ./server:/usr/src/app

volumes:
  perusable-database:
```

Note the changes to the `server` service. The `depends_on` property tells the `server` service to wait for `database` to run before initializing. The `environment` property defines environment variables to be used in the `server` container's runtime environment. The `PGDATABASE`, `PGUSER`, and `PGPASSWORD` variables reference the database, user, and password we set up through `psql`. The `PGHOST` variable references the `database` Docker container name.

Next, add the following Python dependency to the *requirements.txt* file in the *server* directory.

```conf
# server/requirements.txt

Django==3.0.1
psycopg2-binary==2.8.4 # new
```

Are you still running your virtual environment on your local machine? Install the new requirements with `pip`.

```
(venv)$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Open the *settings.py* file in the *server/perusable/perusable* folder. Replace `INSTALLED_APPS` with the following.

```python
# server/perusable/perusable/settings.py

DJANGO_APPS = [
    'django.contrib.admin',
    'django.contrib.auth',
    'django.contrib.contenttypes',
    'django.contrib.sessions',
    'django.contrib.messages',
    'django.contrib.staticfiles',
]

THIRD_PARTY_APPS = []

LOCAL_APPS = [
    'catalog.apps.CatalogConfig',
]

INSTALLED_APPS = DJANGO_APPS + THIRD_PARTY_APPS + LOCAL_APPS
```

Taking this action tells Django to "install" our `catalog` app. Installing a Django app allows it to interact with the database.

Replace `DATABASES` with the following.

```python
# server/perusable/perusable/settings.py

DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',
        'NAME': os.getenv('PGDATABASE'),
        'USER': os.getenv('PGUSER'),
        'PASSWORD': os.getenv('PGPASSWORD'),
        'HOST': os.getenv('PGHOST', 'localhost'),
        'PORT': os.getenv('PGPORT', '5432'),
    }
}
```

Remember how we installed the `psycopg2-binary` Python dependency? This library lets Django access Postgres.

With the proper settings in place, let's create the data model to support our wine catalog. From the *server/perusable/catalog* directory, change the code in *models.py* to the following.

```python
# server/perusable/catalog/models.py

import uuid

from django.db import models


class Wine(models.Model):
    id = models.UUIDField(
        primary_key=True, default=uuid.uuid4, editable=False
    )
    country = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    description = models.TextField(null=True, blank=True)
    points = models.IntegerField()
    price = models.DecimalField(
        decimal_places=2, max_digits=10, null=True, blank=True
    )
    variety = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    winery = models.CharField(max_length=255)

    def __str__(self):
        return f'{self.id}'
```

We're defining a **Wine** model with seven fields. We're using a [UUID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier) (e.g. `fb433ec2-4686-4f39-a07e-3b06d98f42f0`) as our database table's primary key. And we store a lot of other information about our wine, such as its variety and the winery that produced it.

Now, let's make migrations. Change directories to *server/perusable* and run the following command in your terminal.

```
(venv)$ python manage.py makemigrations catalog
```

The following message should be written to the terminal.

```
Migrations for 'catalog':
  catalog/migrations/0001_initial.py
    - Create model Wine
```

Next, create an admin page to complement the model.

```python
# server/perusable/catalog/admin.py

from django.contrib import admin

from .models import Wine


@admin.register(Wine)
class WineAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    fields = ('id', 'country', 'description', 'points', 'price', 'variety', 'winery',)
    list_display = ('id', 'country', 'points', 'price', 'variety', 'winery',)
    list_filter = ('country', 'variety', 'winery',)
    ordering = ('variety',)
    readonly_fields = ('id',)
```

Rebuild the Docker container.

```
(venv)$ docker-compose up -d --build
```

In order to access the admin portal, you'll need to create a super user. Run this command in your terminal to access the `manage.py` file in your Docker container.

```
(venv)$ docker-compose exec server python /usr/src/app/perusable/manage.py createsuperuser
```

Fill in the inputs with your own values.

Visit [http://localhost:8001/admin/](http://localhost:8001/admin/) in your browser and log in with your superuser credentials. You should see something like the following.

With the data model in place, it's time to create an API that the client can use to query the database. Our goal is to let the client search the wine catalog and filter the results. In REST, we do this by identifying the *wine resource* with a URI. When clients send an `HTTP GET` request to the `/api/v1/catalog/wines/` URI, they can expect to receive a response with the *representations* of the wines in the database. Clients can use *query string parameters* to filter the results.

Start by adding the following code to *server/perusable/catalog/views.py*.

```python
# server/perusable/catalog/views.py

from django.db.models import Q
from django.http import JsonResponse
from django.views import View

from .models import Wine


class WinesView(View):
    def get(self, request, *args, **kwargs):
        # Get query string parameters from the request.
        query = self.request.GET.get('query', '')
        country = self.request.GET.get('country', '')
        points = self.request.GET.get('points', '')

        # Build search query.
        if any([query, country, points]):
            search_query = Q(
                Q(variety__contains=query) |
                Q(winery__contains=query) |
                Q(description__contains=query)
            )
            if country:
                search_query &= Q(country=country)
            if points:
                search_query &= Q(points=int(points))
            wines = Wine.objects.filter(search_query)
        else:
            wines = Wine.objects.none()

        # Build response payload.
        return JsonResponse(data=[{
            'id': wine.id,
            'country': wine.country,
            'description': wine.description,
            'points': wine.points,
            'price': wine.price,
            'variety': wine.variety,
            'winery': wine.winery,
        } for wine in wines], safe=False)
```

The Python code is our view function is executed in several parts:
1. We extract query string parameters from the incoming HTTP request
1. We build a database query to find wines whose `variety` or `winery` or `description` contain the specified search term
1. We filter the query to only include wines whose `country` and `points` match the supplied values, if they exist
1. We build a JSON-serialized response payload and return it to the client

Next create a new *urls.py* file in the *catalog* app with the following code.

```python
# server/perusable/catalog/urls.py

from django.urls import path

from .views import WinesView

urlpatterns = [
    path('wines/', WinesView.as_view()),
]
```

Edit the *perusable/urls.py* file to include the `catalog` URLs.

```python
# server/perusable/perusable/urls.py

from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import include, path

urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('api/v1/catalog/', include('catalog.urls')),
]
```

At this point, we have a working API, but we don't have any data.

Create a *fixtures* directory in the *server/perusable/catalog* folder.

```
(venv)$ mkdir -p fixtures
```

Download the *wines.json.zip* file, unzip it, and copy the *wines.json* file to the new *fixtures* directory.

[https://gitlab.devops.eab.com/ParentJ/perusable/blob/master/wines.json.zip](https://gitlab.devops.eab.com/ParentJ/perusable/blob/master/wines.json.zip)

Load the fixture data with the following command. Remember, any files you add to your local machine are automatically copied to your Docker container.

```
(venv)$ docker-compose exec server \
python /usr/src/app/perusable/manage.py loaddata \
/usr/src/app/perusable/catalog/fixtures/wines.json \
--app catalog \
--format json
```

After a couple seconds you should see the following.

```
Installed 150930 object(s) from 1 fixture(s)
```

Return to the admin page in your browser and click on the **Wines** link. You should see many wines.

Now that our wine data is loaded into our database, let's test out our API. From your terminal, run the following command.

```
(venv)$ curl "http://localhost:8001/api/v1/catalog/wines/?query=merlot&country=US&points=90"
```

You should get back a list with two wines.
