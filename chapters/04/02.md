## Testing

Testing client code is different than testing server code because with the client we care how our application works and how it looks. When testing the server, we assessed whether the units of code (the functions) processed the given inputs into the correct outputs. On the client, we need to think in terms of user experience. Here's an example of behavior we want to test: when a user types a query into an input field and clicks the "Search" button, results should load onto the screen.

In this case, we're testing the application end-to-end. Behind the scenes, our app links UI components to functions that trigger communication between the client and the server. Instead of examining the minutiae of how the code works together, we want to test whether the application does what it is meant to do from the perspective of the user.

[Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) is software that lets you test anything that runs in a browser.

Open your terminal and install it. Then open it using the following commands.

```
$ npm install cypress --save-dev
$ npx cypress open
```

Cypress is installed with many example tests, which you can see when you open the software.

We're going to start from scratch. Run the following commands in your terminal to clean the slate.

```
$ rm -rf cypress/fixtures/*
$ rm -rf cypress/integration/*
$ rm -rf cypress/plugins/*
$ rm -rf cypress/support/*
```

Now, our directory should have the following files. (The *node_modules* directory is hidden from this view.)

```
.

```

Notice that Cypress files are installed at the root of the *client* directory. Unlike many testing libraries, Cypress does not integrate with our code directly. In fact, you can point Cypress to *any* website and run tests against it!

Before we write our first test, let's add one bit of configuration that will help us in the long run. Add a `baseUrl` to the *cypress.json* file that points to the development server's local address.

```js
// client/cypress.json

{
  "baseUrl": "http://localhost:3000"
}
```

With this configuration in place, we can avoid having to explicitly call out the complete URL every time we navigate somewhere in the browser or capture an API request.

Let's get our feet wet with a simple test. Create a new *all.spec.js* file in the *cypress/integration* directory with the following code.

```js
// client/cypress/integration/all.spec.js

describe('Perusable', function () {
  it('Displays the home page.', function () {
    cy.visit('/');
    cy.get('h1').should('contain', 'Perusable');
  });
});
```

Cypress tests read something close to plain English. This scenario says:

1. Visit the home page.
1. Look for a heading.
1. Confirm that it contains the words "Perusable".

Open Cypress and click on the "Run all specs" button to launch the test. (Make sure the React development server is running too or Cypress will throw a warning!)

Our trivial test should pass.
