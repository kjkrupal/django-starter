## Docker

Now that we've completed the client code, we have one remaining step to take before wrapping up this chapter. We need to create a Docker container to run our UI. For now we're going to use the development version of React since we're running everything on our local machine.

Do you remember the *nginx.conf* file we created back in **Part I**? All client request paths are forwarded to the `client` Docker container for processing. We need a running React server to capture those incoming requests and execute the right code.

Let's start by creating a *Dockerfile* with the following code in the *client* directory:

```Dockerfile
# client/Dockerfile

FROM node:13.5-alpine

RUN mkdir -p /usr/src/app

WORKDIR /usr/src/app

ENV PATH /usr/src/app/node_modules/.bin:$PATH

COPY package.json /usr/src/app/package.json

COPY package-lock.json /usr/src/app/package-lock.json

RUN npm install --production

COPY . /usr/src/app
```

This file loads the `node:13.5-alpine` base image and then creates a */usr/src/app* directory inside it, which it sets as the working directory. Next, it adds the *node_modules* binaries to the `PATH` environment variable. Taking this action allows the executable files in *node_modules* to be run directly from the terminal. The next two steps copy the *package.json* and *package-lock.json* files into the remote machine. Then, we install all production dependencies.

> **NOTE:** The production dependencies do not include the packages listed in the `devDependencies` section of *package.json*, such as Cypress. There's no reason to install and run Cypress on the remote machine.

Finally, we copy everything in the *client* directory on the host machine to the remote machine. Are you wondering why we need to copy *package.json* and *package-lock.json* independently? As the [Docker best practices documentation](https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/dockerfile_best-practices/#add-or-copy) explains: "This ensures that each step's build cache is only invalidated (forcing the step to be re-run) if the specifically required files change."

Let's also add a *.dockerignore* file at the same location as the *Dockerfile* with the following code:

```conf
# client/.dockerignore

.DS_Store
.dockerignore
.gitignore
README.md
cypress
cypress.json
node_modules
```

With our two new Docker files in place, we can update our *cypress.json* file to point to port `8080` (from Nginx).

```js
// client/cypress.json

{
  "baseUrl": "http://localhost:8080"
}
```

We can also refactor our Cypress tests to hit the actual APIs instead of mocking the responses.

```js
// client/cypress/integration/all.spec.js

it('Displays a list of results.', function () {
  cy.server();
  // changed
  cy.route('GET', '**/api/v1/catalog/wines/**')
    .as('getWines');

  cy.visit('/');

  cy.get('input[placeholder="Enter a search term (e.g. cabernet)"]')
    .type('cabernet');

  cy.get('button').contains('Search').click();
  cy.wait('@getWines');
  cy.get('div.card-winery').should('contain', 'Staglin Cabernet Sauvignon');
});

it('Displays wine search words.', function () {
  cy.server();
  // changed
  cy.route('GET', '**/api/v1/catalog/wine-search-words/**')
    .as('getWineSearchWords');

  cy.visit('/');
  cy.get('input[placeholder="Enter a search term (e.g. cabernet)"]')
    .type('cabarnet');
  cy.wait('@getWineSearchWords');
  cy.get('ul#query').should('contain', 'cabernet');
});
```

Build and run all of the Docker containers.

```
$ docker-compose down && docker-compose up -d --build
```

Run the Cypress tests one last time to confirm that they're still working.
