## Highlighting

Elasticsearch supports highlighting too. Run the following `cURL` command in your terminal.

```
$ curl -X POST "http://localhost:9201/wine/_search?size=100&pretty" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '
{
  "query": {
    "bool": {
      "should": [
        {
          "match": {
            "variety": {
              "query": "merlot",
              "boost": 3.0
            }
          }
        },
        {
          "match": {
            "winery": {
              "query": "merlot",
              "boost": 2.0
            }
          }
        },
        {
          "match": {
            "description": {
              "query": "merlot",
              "boost": 1.0
            }
          }
        }
      ],
      "filter": [
        {"term": {"country": "US"}},
        {"term": {"points": 94}}
      ],
      "minimum_should_match": 1
    }
  },
  "highlight": {
    "fields": {
      "variety": {},
      "winery": {},
      "description": {}
    },
    "number_of_fragments": 0,
    "pre_tags": ["<mark>"],
    "post_tags": ["</mark>"]
  }
}
'
```

This request tells Elasticsearch to surround matches with the `<mark></mark>` HTML tags. The `number_of_fragments=0` property instructs Elasticsearch to add the HTML to the full field text. Lastly, you can specify the fields that you want to participate in highlighting. Here, we've only selected the full text search fields.

Check out a sample result below. The highlighting information is included alongside `_source` in a `highlight` property. Do you see the matches surrounded by `<mark></mark>`?

```
{
  "_index" : "wine",
  "_type" : "_doc",
  "_id" : "b40c1a9e-5cfa-4793-b53f-6a62cb588b82",
  "_score" : 14.157244,
  "_source" : {
    "variety" : "Merlot",
    "country" : "US",
    "price" : 65.0,
    "winery" : "Carter",
    "description" : "New oak dominates this wine, with a rich eruption of toasted meringue, vanilla, burnt butter sauce and woodspice aromas and flavors, yet beneath that elaborate veneer is a wine that easily supports it. The fruit is fantastically concentrated, suggesting cherries and black raspberries baked into a pie—pie crust, and dusting of cinnamon sugar and cocoa included. For all that, the wine is thoroughly dry. Whoever says Merlot is dead should taste this beauty.",
    "points" : 94
  },
  "highlight" : {
    "variety" : [
      "<mark>Merlot</mark>"
    ],
    "description" : [
      "New oak dominates this wine, with a rich eruption of toasted meringue, vanilla, burnt butter sauce and woodspice aromas and flavors, yet beneath that elaborate veneer is a wine that easily supports it.

    ]
  }
}
```

Alter our `ESWinesView` to include the highlighted markup in the search result as shown in the following code. We make the changes to the `get()` function.

```python
# server/perusable/catalog/views.py

class ESWinesView(APIView):
    def get(self, request, *args, **kwargs):
        query = self.request.query_params.get('query')
        country = self.request.query_params.get('country')
        points = self.request.query_params.get('points')

        # Build Elasticsearch query.
        search = Search()
        q = {'should': [], 'filter': []}

        # Build should clause.
        if query:
            q['should'] = [
                Match(variety={'query': query, 'boost': 3.0}),
                Match(winery={'query': query, 'boost': 2.0}),
                Match(description={'query': query, 'boost': 1.0})
            ]
            q['minimum_should_match'] = 1

            # Build highlighting.
            search = search.highlight_options( # new
                number_of_fragments=0,
                pre_tags=['<mark>'],
                post_tags=['</mark>']
            )
            search = search.highlight('variety', 'winery', 'description') # new

        # Build filter clause.
        if country:
            q['filter'].append(Term(country=country))
        if points:
            q['filter'].append(Term(points=points))

        response = search.query('bool', **q).params(size=100).execute()

        if response.hits.total.value > 0:
            return Response(data=[{ # changed
                'variety': (
                    hit.meta.highlight.variety[0]
                    if 'highlight' in hit.meta and 'variety' in hit.meta.highlight
                    else hit.variety
                ),
                'country': hit.country,
                'price': hit.price,
                'winery': (
                    hit.meta.highlight.winery[0]
                    if 'highlight' in hit.meta and 'winery' in hit.meta.highlight
                    else hit.winery
                ),
                'description': (
                    hit.meta.highlight.description[0]
                    if 'highlight' in hit.meta and 'description' in hit.meta.highlight
                    else hit.description
                ),
                'points': hit.points,
            } for hit in response])
        else:
            return Response(data=[])
```

In addition to adding the `highlight` clause to our search body, we make big changes to how we build our response data. Instead of passing the `_source` directly from the results, we build the data to use the `highlight` data if it exists, and we fall back on the `_source` data if `highlight` data is absent.

Let's make one more change to our code. Change the *catalog/urls.py* file to contain the following.

```python
# server/perusable/catalog/urls.py

from django.urls import path

from .views import WinesView, WineSearchWordsView, ESWinesView

urlpatterns = [
    path('wines/', ESWinesView.as_view()), # changed
    path('wine-search-words/', WineSearchWordsView.as_view()),
    path('es-wines/', ESWinesView.as_view()),
    path('pg-wines/', WinesView.as_view()), # new
]
```

Now, when clients hit the `/wines/` API endpoint, they'll hit the Elasticsearch service. We preserve the Postgres full text search API with the `/pg-wines/` endpoint.

Open the app in your browser to test the new data source.
