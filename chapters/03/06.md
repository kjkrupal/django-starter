## Suggesters

In the previous chapter, we demonstrated how to make suggestions for misspelled words using fuzzy search. Let's jog our memory and analyze how the process works for Postgres.

The first step is to create a database table of all the words that comprise our wine documents. Then, we compare our search term with each word in the database and score how closely they match using a trigram similarity algorithm. Lastly, we return a list of matched words sorted by score -- the more closely the words match, the higher they appear on the list.

Elasticsearch has a concept called [Suggesters](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-suggesters.html) that help find words that closely match a search term. Unlike Postgres, Elasticsearch doesn't require the developer to track words in a separate database or perform complicated business logic to construct of list of similar terms. All of the matching logic works out of the box without requiring additional setup.

Before we write any code, let's play with the Elasticsearch API over HTTP. Open your terminal and copy the following command:

```
$ curl -X POST "http://localhost:9201/wine/_search?pretty" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '
{
  "suggest": {
    "result": {
      "text": "cabernay",
      "term": {
        "field": "variety"
      }
    }
  }
}
'
```

We get suggestions using the same `_search` API that we use to perform a search. The key is that we need to include the `suggest` object. In particular, we're using the [Term suggester](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-suggesters.html#term-suggester), which suggests terms based on edit distance. In other words, it performs a match using an algorithm somewhat like Postgres' fuzzy search. In our example above, we pass in the search term `cabernay` and the field that we want to analyze. In plain English, we're asking Elasticsearch to give us all words in our documents' variety fields that are similar to "cabernay".

When you run the query, you should get the following result:

```
{
  "took" : 4,
  "timed_out" : false,
  "_shards" : {
    "total" : 1,
    "successful" : 1,
    "skipped" : 0,
    "failed" : 0
  },
  "hits" : {
    "total" : {
      "value" : 0,
      "relation" : "eq"
    },
    "max_score" : null,
    "hits" : [ ]
  },
  "suggest" : {
    "result" : [
      {
        "text" : "cabernai",
        "offset" : 0,
        "length" : 8,
        "options" : [
          {
            "text" : "cabernet",
            "score" : 0.75,
            "freq" : 31566
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

The suggestions are organized by score, with the token "cabernet" most closely matching the tokenized search term "cabernai" with a score of `0.75` and a frequency of `31566`. Not only is "cabernet" the best match in terms of score, it also appears in our documents 31,566 times. Chances are "cabernet" is what we're looking for. 

You're probably wondering why the matches are tokens and not whole words. The reason is because our Elasticsearch index tokenizes our documents using the English analyzer and uses those tokens to do the matching.

If we want to get a list of words instead of tokens, then we need to make the following changes:
1. Add a new text field to our index to hold all values involved in full text search
2. Copy values from the `variety`, `winery`, and `description` fields to the new text field
3. Update our index mapping and reindex our wine data

Edit the contents of the *constants.py* file in the following way:

```py
# server/perusable/catalog/constants.py

ES_MAPPING = {
    'dynamic': 'strict',
    'properties': {
        'variety': {
            'type': 'text',
            'analyzer': 'english',
            # new
            'copy_to': 'all_text',
        },
        'country': {
            'type': 'keyword',
        },
        'price': {
            'type': 'keyword',
        },
        'winery': {
            'type': 'text',
            'analyzer': 'english',
            # new
            'copy_to': 'all_text',
        },
        'description': {
            'type': 'text',
            'analyzer': 'english',
            # new
            'copy_to': 'all_text',
        },
        'points': {
            'type': 'float',
        },
        # new
        'all_text': {
            'type': 'text',
        },
    }
}
```

Next, run the `elasticsearch` management command to update the mapping and reindex the wine data.

```
$ docker-compose exec server python /usr/src/app/perusable/manage.py elasticsearch
```

You should see the following output in your terminal:

```
Checking if index "wine" exists...
Index "wine" already exists
Updating mapping on "wine" index...
Updated mapping on "wine" successfully
Bulk updating documents on "wine" index...
Updated 150930 documents on "wine" successfully
```

Lastly, rerun the `cURL` command in your terminal with these new parameters:

```
$ curl -X POST "http://localhost:9201/wine/_search?pretty" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '
{
  "suggest": {
    "result": {
      "text": "cabernay",
      "term": {
        "field": "all_text"
      }
    }
  }
}
'
```

One notable feature of the `copy_to` property is that it copies the field's value before it undergoes analysis. That's why "cabernay" is converted to "cabernai" in the `variety` field yet remains "cabernay" in the `all_text` field.

You should see the following output in your terminal:

```
{
  "took" : 4,
  "timed_out" : false,
  "_shards" : {
    "total" : 1,
    "successful" : 1,
    "skipped" : 0,
    "failed" : 0
  },
  "hits" : {
    "total" : {
      "value" : 0,
      "relation" : "eq"
    },
    "max_score" : null,
    "hits" : [ ]
  },
  "suggest" : {
    "result" : [
      {
        "text" : "cabernay",
        "offset" : 0,
        "length" : 8,
        "options" : [
          {
            "text" : "cabernet",
            "score" : 0.75,
            "freq" : 42328
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

The `freq` value has increased because the search now involves the `winery` and `description` fields' text too. Now we can write some code.

Let's start by making a "wine search words" API that uses Elasticsearch suggesters. Add the following code to the *views.py* file:

```py
# server/perusable/catalog/views.py

class ESWineSearchWordsView(APIView):
    def get(self, request, *args, **kwargs):
        query = self.request.query_params.get('query')

        # Build Elasticsearch query.
        search = Search().suggest('result', query, term={
            'field': 'all_text'
        })

        response = search.execute()

        # Extract words.
        options = response.suggest.result[0]['options']
        words = [{'word': option['text']} for option in options]

        return Response(data=words)
```

In this API, we build the Elasticsearch query to get suggestions for the `all_text` field. Then, we execute the query and extract the list of words from the results. It's worth noting here that our code only handles the case where the user searches for a single term.

Let's modify our URLs.

```python
# server/perusable/catalog/urls.py

from django.urls import path

# changed
from .views import (
    WinesView, WineSearchWordsView,
    ESWinesView, ESWineSearchWordsView
)

# changed
urlpatterns = [
    path('wines/', ESWinesView.as_view()),
    path('es-wines/', ESWinesView.as_view()),
    path('pg-wines/', WinesView.as_view()),
    path('wine-search-words/', ESWineSearchWordsView.as_view()),
    path('es-wine-search-words/', ESWineSearchWordsView.as_view()),
    path('pg-wine-search-words/', WineSearchWordsView.as_view()),
]
```

Hit the new API endpoint in your browser to test it.
