## Next Steps

1. Does the Elasticsearch Query DSL return what you expect when you search for more than one word at a time? What can you do to tweak the results?
1. Instead of the Term suggester, try using the [Completion suggester](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-suggesters.html#completion-suggester) to fill in the rest of the word as you type it.
1. Refactor the Term suggester to work like Google when you search for a misspelled word: "Did you mean ___?"
