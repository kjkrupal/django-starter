## System Design

Before we start coding, let's look at how our current system design is going to change.

The diagram above looks the same as the one we saw in **Part I** with one exception -- we're adding [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch). *Elasticsearch* is a distributed, RESTful search and analytics engine. You can run it on your laptop or on hundreds of servers in the cloud. You communicate with the engine by sending HTTP requests to an API. While our *database* supports basic full text search, *Elasticsearch* offers much more functionality out of the box. And it handles large-scale indexing and searching effortlessly.

The purpose of this tutorial is to introduce you to the basics of Elasticsearch and teach you how to communicate with the service from a Django app.
